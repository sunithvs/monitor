Here is a sample README file for the keyboard and mouse monitoring application:

# Keyboard and Mouse Monitoring Application

This is a simple Python program that implements a keyboard and mouse monitoring application using sockets. The program has two parts: a server and a client.

## Setup

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
2. Install the `pynput` library by running `pip install pynput` in your command prompt or terminal.
3. Download the `server.py` and `client.py` files from this repository.

## Running the Application

1. Open two command prompts or terminals.
2. In the first one, navigate to the directory where you downloaded the `server.py` file and run `python server.py`.
3. In the second one, navigate to the directory where you downloaded the `client.py` file and run `python client.py`.
4. The server will start listening to all mouse and keyboard events and send them to the client using sockets. The client will listen to the server and print the data sent from the server.

## Sample Output

Here is a sample output of what you might see when running the application:

```

Mouse released at (427, 531) with Button.left

```

Is there anything else you would like me to add or change in this README file?
